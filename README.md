# BlackjackAI
YOLO model that opens up instagram and logs in with cookies, and screenshots live stream from Meta-Rayban glasses. Then it runs yolo inference to find cards and adds them to the current count without repeats. Texts the count to the glasses through whatsapp. 

Had to get around challenges of the glasses as they do not stream normal video or accept normal communication. Used selenium webdriver to circumvent this but required loading cookies to login to instagram and whatsapp.
